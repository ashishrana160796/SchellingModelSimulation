This Repository contains Program code for Simulation Of Schelling Model.
 
Which involves analysis of nodes on 2-D grid for community formation against the given iterations and given threshold neighbours.

Contents :

1. --1.SchellingModelBaseCode.py
	 
	 --A sample code for construction of 2-D grid with proper attributes attached to it.
	   
2. --2.SchellinModelInternalAndExternalNodes.py
	
	 -- This code contains additional methods to get the internal and external nodes plus color label also assigned to nodes for visualization.
	 
3. --3.SchellingModelUnsatisfiedNodes.py
	 
	 -- This code contains additional method to check the unsatisfied that exist in the grid.	

4. --4.SchellingModelSimulatingMovement.py 
	 
	 -- This is complete code for simulation with given number of iterations which also takes into account the changing parameters because of movement of nodes along the grid.
